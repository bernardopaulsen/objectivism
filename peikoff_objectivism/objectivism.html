<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >We will now begin to identify the rules men must follow in their thinking
if knowledge is the goal. These rules can be condensed into one principle:
thinking, to be valid, must adhere to reality. But how does one
guarantee adherence to reality? The answer lies in the concept of
&#8220;objectivity&#8221;.

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Objectivity&#8221; arises because concepts are formed by a specific
process and, as a result, bear a specific kind of relationship to
reality. Concepts do not pertrain to consciousness alone or to
existence alone, they are products of a specific kind of relationship
between the two. Abstractions are products of man&#8217;s faculty of
cognition, which, concerned with grasping reality, must adhere to
it.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Conceptualization is not an automatic reaction to stimuli (as is
perception). Concept formation is volitional, requiring effort. Man must
learn to do it correctly. In such processing, the basic method he uses,
measurement-omission, is dictated by the nature of his cognitive faculty.
The result is a human perspective on things, not a revelation of a
special sort of entity or attribute intrinsic in the world apart from
man.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, consciousness is the faculty of grasping
that which is, and there is a metaphysical basis for concepts. The
charateristics of entities is a fact, not a creation of man. The method of
concept formation conforms each step to facts, otherwise it would be
irrelevant to a cognitive need.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   We define two classes of concepts wich are not objective: stolen
concepts, which is the use of a higher-level concept while denying or
ignoring its hierarchical roots; invalid concepts, which are words

concept is the fact that it cannot be reduced to the perceptual
level).

<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Concepts are a relational form of knowledge. In other words, concepts
are formed in a context &#8212; by relating concretes to a field of contrasting
entities. This body of relationships, which constitutes the context of the
concept, is what determines its meaning. Human knowledge on every
level is relational. Knowledge is not a juxtaposition of independent
items; it is a unity.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Metaphysically, there is only one universe. This means that

seeks to grasp reality, must also be a total; its elements must be
interconnected to form a unified whole reflecting the whole which is the
universe.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Leaving aside the primaries of cognition, which are selfevident, all

Higher-level concepts, by contrast, presuppose earlier concepts. A
definite order of concept-formation in necessary. We begin with those
abstractions that are closest to the perceptually given and mode
gradually away from them.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   The same principle of order applies to ecery field of human
knowledge, nor merely to concept-formation - knowledge has a
hierarchical structure. A hierarchy of knowledge means a body of
concepts and conclusions ranked in order of lofical dependence.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   The cencept or hierarchy is epistemological, not metaphysical, as
facts are simultaneous in reality.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   An order of logical dependence exists from man&#8217;s perspective,
because man cannot come to know all facts with the same directness. In
some but not all cases, the hierarchy of human knowledge depends
on the nature of man&#8217;s senses - on the type of information they
provide.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   The hierarchical view of knowledge states not only that every

an inner structure of logical dependence.

<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Reason is a faculty of awareness; its function is to perceive that which
exists by organizing observational data. And reason is a volitional
faculty; it has the power to direct its own actions and check its
conclusions, the power to maintain a certain relationship to the facts of
reality. Emotion, by contrast, is a faculty not of perception, but of
reaction to one&#8217;s perceptions. This kind of faculty has no power of
observation and no volition; it has no means of independent access to
reality, no means to guide its own course, and no capacity to monitor its
own relationship to facts.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Emotions are automatic consequences of a mind&#8217;s past conclusions.
Feeling follows obediently. It has no power to question its course or to

should not ignore his feelings. He should identify the ideas at their base

his conscious conclusions, weighing the conflicts objectively; then amend
his viewpoint accordingly, disavowing the ideas he judges to be
false

consideration, or argument

<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   If an idea is cut loose from any means of cognition, there is no way of
bringing it into relationship with reality
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   An arbitrary idea must be given the exact treatment its nature
demands. One must treat it as though nothing had been said. The
reason is that, cognitively speaking, nothing has been said. One cannot
allow into the realm of cognition something that repudiates every rule of
that realm.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   The true is identified by reference to a body of evidence; it is

pronounced &#8221;false&#8221; because it contradicts the evidence and/or some
aspect of the wider context. The arbitrary, however, has no relation to
evidence or context; neither term, therefore&#8212;&#8221;true&#8221; or &#8221;false&#8221;&#8212;can be

does so, one must either accept his conclusion, or disqualify his
evidence by showing that he has misinterpreted certain data. But
if he offers no supporting evidence, one must dismiss his claim
without argumentation, because in this situation argument would
be futile. It is impossible to &#8221;prove a negative,&#8221; meaning by the
term: prove the nonexistence of an entity for which there is no
evidence
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   a nonexistent is nothing; it is not a constituent of reality, and it has

grow mentally, to increase one&#8217;s knowledge and expand the power of
one&#8217;s consciousness to the extent one can, whatever one&#8217;s profession or
the degree of one&#8217;s intelligence.

<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Just as every idea has a relationship to one&#8217;s other ideas, and none
can be accepted until it is seen to be an element of a single cognitive
whole; so every fact has a relationship to other facts, and none
can be evaded without tearing apart and destroying that kind of
whole.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   The existential side of rationality is the policy of acting in accordance
with one&#8217;s rational conclusions. There is no point in using one&#8217;s
mind if the knowledge one gains thereby is not one&#8217;s guide in
action.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   This aspect of rationality subsumes several obligations.29 It requires
that one choose not only his abstract values but also his specific goals by
a process of rational thought. It requires that one know what his motives
are. It requires that one choose the means to his ends by reference to
explicitly defined principles, both moral and scientific. And it requires
that one then enact the means, accepting the law of causality in
full.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   In epistemology, we concluded that emotions are not tools of

Values are not intrinsic features of reality, they require a valuer - the

the realm of facts is what creates the need to choose a certain

alone, it arises because a certain kink of entity - a living, volitional,

good designates facts - the requirements of survival - as identified
conceptually.

is to deny him the possibility of acting on reason, thus turning any
virtuous action (value achievement) impossible.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   A (rational) victim of force still thinks what he thinks, as force
cannot change the content of one&#8217;s mind. Thus the victim of force acts
<span

mind acts virtuously, to act against its judgement is to act perversely, to
act against one&#8217;s own life. Initiating force, when it does not kill the
victim, kills his capacity to live.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Coercion places the individual in an impossible metaphysical

obligation: oth- ers may not properly violate his rights.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   &#8221;Individual rights,&#8221; in short, is a redundancy, albeit a neces-
sary one in today&#8217;s intellectual chaos. Only the individual has
rights.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   The rights of man, Ayn Rand holds, can be violated by one means

<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Metaphysically, the individual is sovereign (he is a being of

independent egoist). Politically, therefore, he must be able to act as a
sovereign.
