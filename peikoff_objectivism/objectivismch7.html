being is he? What are his essential attributes?

man’s metaphysical nature.

desirable or undesirable, good or evil. The concern here is a purely factual question: what
is the essence of human nature?

to produce objects in reality he needs to deal with reality. For man’s actions to be
successful in dealing with reality, he needs to know reality. The method of knowing
reality is reason. Reason, therefore, is man’s basic tool of survival.                    □
