    This book is based on \cite{peikoff1993}. Peikoff's book develops the philosophy of Objectivism systematically. Nevertheless, I believe it would be interesting to see it written in a more straightforward manner. That is what I try to accomplish in this book.
    
    %Now, a disclaimer: I'm (extremely) new to philosophy, and I have never studied philosophy formally - only by reading books by my own. I have written this book beacuse Objectivism - especially as a full philosophical system - helped me understand the interconnections and interdependences between ideas as no other philosophy ever did. I do not expect the ideas on this book to be perfectly developed. Also I do not expect to forever hold the opinions that derive from them. However, I do expect to continue to believe in what I consider the main ideas presented in this book - reason and liberty.
    

    I hope you enjoy.
