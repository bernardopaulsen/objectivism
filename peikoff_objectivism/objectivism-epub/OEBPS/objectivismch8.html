<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Ethis is the branch of philisophy that deals with moral principles (Defintion <a 
href="objectivismch1.html#x5-4009r9">.0.9<!--tex4ht:ref: def:ethics --></a>). Moral
principles are to guide man’s choices and actions - which determine the purpose and
course of his life. Man needs a moral code because his life requires a specific course of
action and, being a conceptual entity, he cannot follow this course except by the guidance
of concepts.
</p><!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   There are two key questions aswered by ethics: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Fow what a man should live?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">By what fundamental principle should he act in order to achieve this end?</li></ul>
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   These quetions determine the ultimate value and the primary virtue. Our answers, at
the end of this chapter, will be the following: the ultimate value is life (oneself’s), and the
primary virtue is rationality.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   The main problem of ethics, as a brach of phiolosophy that follows metaphysics and
epistemology is: how can knowledge about what is bring to the knowledge of what ought
to be? We will hold in this chapter that facts do lead to values.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Ehics can be validated objectively, it is a science (it can be discovered with cognition)
- and a human necessity.

<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Man (and only man) needs morality in order to survive. Moral laws are principles
that define how to nourish and sustain human life. It is the science of human
self-preservation. Man needs a moral code because his life requires a specific course of
action and, being a conceptual entity, he cannot follow this course except by the guidance
of concepts.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   No action an organism takes is irrelevant to its existence, therefore, morality applies
to every action. For a rational being, principled action is the only effective kind of
action.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   A code of values based on reason and proper to man must hold life as the ultimate
value. All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that which
destroys it is the evil.

<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >What are the principles of human survival? What objects must man hold as values if he
is to preserve his life, and what virtues must he practice in order to achieve
them?
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The faculty of reason is man’s basic tool of survival. The primary choice is to exercise
this faculty or not. If life is the standard, therefore, the basic moral principle is obvious.
It tells us the proper evaluation of reason.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:
Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as his
choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Self-esteem, as his
inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of
happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values imply and require all of
man’s virtues...

   </div>
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   ”Rationality,” according to Ayn Rand, is ”the recognition and acceptance of reason as
one’s only source of knowledge, one’s only judge of values and one’s only guide to
action.”
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   This means the application of reason to every aspect of one’s life and concerns. It
means choosing and validating one’s opinions, one’s decisions, one’s work, one’s love, in
accor- dance with the normal requirements of a cognitive process, the requirements of
logic, objectivity, integration. Put nega- tively, the virtue means never placing any
consideration above one’s perception of reality.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   By the same token, there is only one primary vice, which is the root of all other
human evils: irrationality. This is the deliberate suspension of consciousness, the refusal
to see, to think, to know.
</p><!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Now let me con- sider certain aspects of rationality in greater detail.
</p><!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   To begin with, one cannot follow reason unless one ex- ercises it. Rationality
demands continual mental activity. Rationality requires the systematic use of one’s
intelligence.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   The point is not that one must become a genius or even an intellectual. Contrary to a
widespread fallacy, reason is a faculty of human beings, not of ”supermen.” The moral
point here is always to grow mentally, to increase one’s knowledge and expand the power
of one’s consciousness to the extent one can, whatever one’s profession or the degree of
one’s intelligence.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The men of virtue are the men who choose to practice and welcome this kind of
struggle on principle, as a lifelong commitment.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Just as every idea has a relationship to one’s other ideas, and none can be accepted
until it is seen to be an element of a single cognitive whole; so every fact has a
relationship to other facts, and none can be evaded without tearing apart and destroying
that kind of whole.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   The existential side of rationality is the policy of acting in accordance with one’s
rational conclusions. There is no point in using one’s mind if the knowledge one gains
thereby is not one’s guide in action.
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   This aspect of rationality subsumes several obligations.29 It requires that one choose
not only his abstract values but also his specific goals by a process of rational thought. It
requires that one know what his motives are. It requires that one choose the means to his
ends by reference to explicitly defined principles, both moral and scientific. And
it requires that one then enact the means, accepting the law of causality in
full.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   In epistemology, we concluded that emotions are not tools of cognition. The corollary
in ethics is that they are not guides to action.
                                                                     
                                                                     
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   The proper approach in this issue is not reason versus emotion, but reason first and
then emotion. This approach, as we have seen, leads to the harmony of reason and
emotion, which is the normal state of a rational man.

 id="x15-440007.5"></a>Values as Objective</h3>
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Values, like concepts, are not intrinsic or subjective, but objective. Values are not
intrinsic features of reality, they require a valuer - the good is not good in itself, it is good
to man and for the sake of he’s life. Values are neither subjective, they require the
observation of reality - the realm of facts is what creates the need to choose a certain
goal.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   Moral value does not pertain to reality alone or to consciousness alone, it arises
because a certain kink of entity - a living, volitional, conceptual organism - sustains a
certain realtionship to the external world. The good is an aspect of reality in relationship
to man. The good designates facts - the requirements of survival - as identified
conceptually.
</p><!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   Morality is a must - if; it is the price of the choice to live. That choice itself, is not a
moral choice, it preceded morality; it is the decision of consciousness that uderlies the
need of morality.
