<span

</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Reason, following Definition <a 
href="#x12-29001r1">5.0.1<!--tex4ht:ref: def:reason --></a> is a method of cognition that proceeds in
accordance with facts, which are established, directly or indirectly, by observation.
Emotion, on the other hand, following Definition <a 
href="#x12-30001r1">5.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: def:emotion --></a>, is a state of consciousness
which is a response to an object one perceives (or imagines).
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Emotion is the result of past conclusions. It, consequently, cannot be trust as
a means to knowledge, as our past conclusios may be wrong. Reason is exactly
what identifies the true and false whithin our thougths, as it compares them to the
facts.                                                                                                    □

   </div>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Reason is a faculty of awareness; its function is to perceive that which exists by
organizing observational data. And reason is a volitional faculty; it has the power to
direct its own actions and check its conclusions, the power to maintain a certain
relationship to the facts of reality. Emotion, by contrast, is a faculty not of perception,
but of reaction to one’s perceptions. This kind of faculty has no power of observation
and no volition; it has no means of independent access to reality, no means
to guide its own course, and no capacity to monitor its own relationship to
facts.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Emotions are automatic consequences of a mind’s past conclusions. Feeling follows
obediently. It has no power to question its course or to check its roots against reality.
Only man’s volitional, existence-oriented faculty has such power.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   Now, through a study of man’s means of consciousness, this earlier discussion has
been confirmed and completed. Metaphysics and epistemology unite. They unite in
declaring that ”emotions are not tools of cognition.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   The conclusion is clear: there is no alternative or supplement to reason as a means of
knowledge. If one attempts to give emotions such a role, then he has ceased to engage in
the activity of cognition.
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   If an individual experiences a clash between feeling and thought, he should not ignore
his feelings. He should identify the ideas at their base (which may be a time-consuming
process); then compare these ideas to his conscious conclusions, weighing the conflicts
objectively; then amend his viewpoint accordingly, disavowing the ideas he judges to be
false
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   The above indicates the pattern of the proper relationship between reason and
emotion in a man’s life: reason first, emotion as a consequence.

<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >An arbitrary claim is one for which there is no evidence, either perceptual or conceptual.
an arbitrary claim is automatically invalidated. The rational response to such a claim is
to dismiss it, without discussion, consideration, or argument
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   An arbitrary statement has no relation to man’s means of knowledge. Since the
statement is detached from the realm of evidence, no process of logic can assess
it
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Since it is affirmed in a void, cut off from any context, no integration to the rest of
man’s knowledge is applicable; previous knowledge is irrelevant to it. Since it has
no place in a hierarchy, no reduction is possible, and thus no observations are
relevant.
</p><!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   If an idea is cut loose from any means of cognition, there is no way of bringing it into
relationship with reality
</p><!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   An arbitrary idea must be given the exact treatment its nature demands. One must
treat it as though nothing had been said. The reason is that, cognitively speaking,
nothing has been said. One cannot allow into the realm of cognition something that
repudiates every rule of that realm.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   The true is identified by reference to a body of evidence; it is pronounced ”true”
because it can be integrated without contradiction into a total context. The false is
identified by the same means; it is pronounced ”false” because it contradicts the evidence
and/or some aspect of the wider context. The arbitrary, however, has no relation to
evidence or context; neither term, therefore—”true” or ”false”—can be applied to
it.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The onus of proof rule states the following. If a person asserts that a certain entity
exists (such as God, gremlins, a disembodied soul), he is required to adduce evidence
supporting his claim. If he does so, one must either accept his conclusion, or disqualify
his evidence by showing that he has misinterpreted certain data. But if he offers no
supporting evidence, one must dismiss his claim without argumentation, because in
this situation argument would be futile. It is impossible to ”prove a negative,”
meaning by the term: prove the nonexistence of an entity for which there is no
evidence
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   a nonexistent is nothing; it is not a constituent of reality, and it has no effects. If
gremlins, for instance, do not exist, then they are nothing and have no consequences. In
such a case, to say: ”Prove that there are no gremlins/’ is to say: ”Point out the facts of
reality that follow from the nonexistence of gremlins.” But there are no such facts.
Nothing follows from nothing.

<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >Human knowledge is limited. Logical processing of an idea within a specific context of
knowledge is necessary and sufficient to establish the idea’s truth.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   Consciousness has identity, and epistemology is based on the recognition of this fact.
Epistemology investigates the question: what rules must be followed by a human

consciousness, therefore, can be used to undermine it
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   If a fact is inherent in human consciousness, then that fact is not an obstacle to
cognition, but a precondition of it—and one which implies a corresponding
epistemological obligation
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Man is a being of limited knowledge—and he must, there fore, identify the cognitive
context of his conclusions.

available evidence, i.e., within the context of the factors so far discovered, the following is

clash with or annul it.

knowledge, it cannot contradict its own base.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   Although the researchers cannot claim their discovery as an out-of-context absolute,
they must treat it as a contextual absolute (i.e., as an immutable truth within the

</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   This is why there can be no such thing as ”some evi dence” in favor of an entity
transcending nature and logic The term ”evidence” in this context would be a stolen con
cept. Since nothing can ever qualify as a ”proof” of such an entity, there is no way to
identify any data as being a ”part proof” of it, either.
