<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Rationality is the primary virtue, and reason is a faculty of the individual. Therefore, in
order to be rational, one must think independently (a pleonasm). This means not
accepting thoughts or jugdments of others, but to form one’s own. This does not mean
never thinking like other people or accepting ideas created by other, but it does mean
that this acceptance must be rational, the thoughts must be integrated by an act of
reason - thinking.

 id="x16-520008.7"></a>The Initiation of Physical Force as Evil</h3>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >Initiation of physical force is the destruction of rationality, and therefore of every other
virtue and of every value. To force a man to do something is to deny him the
possibility of acting on reason, thus turning any virtuous action (value achievement)
impossible.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   A (rational) victim of force still thinks what he thinks, as force cannot change the
content of one’s mind. Thus the victim of force acts <span 
class="cmti-10">against </span>his judgement, and his
cognition becomes useless. As a rational mind acts virtuously, to act against its
judgement is to act perversely, to act against one’s own life. Initiating force, when it does
not kill the victim, kills his capacity to live.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Coercion places the individual in an impossible metaphysical condition. If he does not
act in accordance with his conlusions, he is doomed by reality. If he does, he is doomed
by the forcer.
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Finally, one important thing to notice is that only initiation - not retaliation -
of physical force is evil. While initiation of physical force destroys rationality,
retaliation protects it. It cannot creates values, however - it can only protect
them.
