are things, but units are things viewed by a consciousness in certain existing
relationships.

knowledge. Without the same implicit conpect man could not enter the field of
mathematics. Thus the same concept is the base and start of two fields: the conceptual

two fields. It suggests that concept-formation is in some way a mathematical
process.

it?

his mind’s grasp of a mathematical fact: the fact that certain concretes are
commensurable — that they (or their attributes) are reducible to the same unit(s) of
measurement.

but also on the truth of the defi- nitions of its constituent concepts. If these concepts
are detached from reality then so are the propositions that employ them. A
proposition can have no greater validity than do the concepts that make it up.
The precondition of the quest for truth, therefore, is the formulation of proper
definitions.

classification which includes the yet-to-be-discovered characteristics of a given group of
existents. One important implication of the above is that a concept, once formed, does
not change. The knowledge men have of the units may grow and the definition
may change accordingly, but the concept, the mental integration, remains the
same.
