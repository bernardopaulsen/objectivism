 id="x11-240004"></a>Objectivity</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >We will now begin to identify the rules men must follow in their thinking if knowledge is
the goal. These rules can be condensed into one principle: thinking, to be valid, must
adhere to reality. But how does one guarantee adherence to reality? The answer lies in
the concept of ”objectivity”.
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1   </span> <a 
 id="x11-250004.1"></a>Concepts as Objective</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >”Objectivity” arises because concepts are formed by a specific process and, as a result,
bear a specific kind of relationship to reality. Concepts do not pertrain to consciousness
alone or to existence alone, they are products of a specific kind of relationship between
the two. Abstractions are products of man’s faculty of cognition, which, concerned with
grasping reality, must adhere to it.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Conceptualization is not an automatic reaction to stimuli (as perception is). Concept
formation is volitional, requiring effort. Man must learn to do it correctly. In such
processing, the basic method he uses, measurement-omission, is dictated by the
nature of his cognitive faculty. The result is a human perspective on things, not a
revelation of a special sort of entity or attribute intrinsic in the world apart from
man.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, consciousness is the faculty of grasping that which is, and there is
a metaphysical basis for concepts. The charateristics of entities is a fact, not a creation of
man. The method of concept formation conforms each step to facts, otherwise it would be
irrelevant to a cognitive need.

<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The objective approach to concepts leads to the view that, beyond the perceptual level,
knowledge is the grasp of an object through an active, reality-based process chosen by the
subject. The steps of this process must contitute a method of cognition, that guarantees
that men remains in contact with reality. We define objectivity in Definition <a 
href="#x11-26001r1">4.2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: def:objectivity --></a>.
Reality, existents, cannot be objetive, they simply are. It is conceptual processes which
are objective.

<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   The method of cognition that objectivity requires is logic (Definition <a 
href="objectivismch2.html#x7-7012r3">1.1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: def:logic --></a>), which is a
volitional consciousness’ method of conforming to reality, it is the method of reason.
Logic is the art of noncontradictory identification.

<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Concepts are a relational form of knowledge.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   In other words, concepts are formed in a context—by relating concretes to a field of
contrasting entities. This body of relationships, which constitutes the context of the
concept, is what determines its meaning.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Human knowledge on every level is relational. Knowledge is not a juxtaposition of
independent items; it is a unity.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The relational nature of knowledge derives from two roots, one pertaining to the
nature of existence, the other, to the nature of consciousness.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Metaphysically, there is only one universe. This means that everything in reality is
interconnected.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Knowledge, therefore, which seeks to grasp reality, must also be a total; its elements
must be interconnected to form a unified whole reflecting the whole which is the
universe.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Leaving aside the primaries of cognition, which are selfevident, all knowledge depends
on a certain relationship: it is based on a context of earlier information.

by contrast, presuppose earlier concepts.

</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   The cencept or hierarchy is epistemological, not metaphysical, as facts are
simultaneous in reality.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   An order of logical dependence exists from man’s perspective, because man cannot
come to know all facts with the same directness. In some but not all cases, the hierarchy
of human knowledge depends on the nature of man’s senses - on the type of information
they provide.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   The hierarchical view of knowledge states not only that every (nonaxiomatic) item
has a context, but also that such context itself has an inner structure of logical
dependence.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   The epistemological responsibility imposed on man by the fact that knowledge is
contextual is the need of integration. The responsibility imposed by the fact that
knowledge is hierarchical is: the need of reduction.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   Stolen concept: using a higher-level concept while denying or ignoring its hierarchical
roots.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Invalid concepts: words without specific definitions, without referents. The test
of an invalid concept is the fact that it cannot be reduced to the perceptual
level.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   Proof is a form of reduction. Proof is a form of retracing the hierarchical steps of the
learning process.
