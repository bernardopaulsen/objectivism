<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Metaphysics is, basically, the identification of the fact of existence and its corollaries.
Epistemology, on the other hand, is the science that studies the nature and means of
human knowledge. If the mind wishes to know existence, it must conform to existence. A
conceptual knowledge can depart from reality, so it needs a method of cognition.
Epistemology is based, therefore, on the premise that man can acquire knowledge only if
he performs certain definite processes.
</p><!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   Every process of knowledge involves the object of cognition and the mens of cognition.
The objects is always some aspect of reality (there is nothing else to know).
The means pertains to the kind of consciousness and determines the form of
cognition.

volition to prove it (we saw an analogous situation when it is asked to prove the
